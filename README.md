# Jets Project

# Description
This is my third weekend project at Skill Distillery boot camp. This project was to create an air field and have it contain a fleet of jets that can be accessed and run from a displayed menu. Upon launching the program you will be able to view the fleet, add or remove jets to the fleet, call the interface methods specific to certain jet types, or find specific information about the top performing jets. 
# What I learned
This week took on a lot of new information and put it into use. I was able to take information from a .txt file using a buffered reader. Work on Object oriented programming principles like Encapsulation to hide private data, Inheritance to share behavior between parent and child classes, and Polymorphism to let a child class override the parent class to perform its own behavior. I worked with down casting, array lists, reading a UML diagram, exception handing with my user inputs to ensure expected input was correct, and overall enforcing proper coding standards and my general understanding of the Java language and Object Oriented Programming.
